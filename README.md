  <h3 class="margin">My Story</h3>
  <p>Being an educator â€¦ there is nothing like it. I will complete this year of teaching this June and the experience has been more than I ever could have asked for to start my career. I am now planning to relocate back home to Michigan, and would love to bring the same level of innovation and commitment to the students at Airport High School as their Business Education Teacher.

As a business teacher, I delved into as much as I could these past two years, from teaching six different courses to coaching track and wrestling. By developing and presenting innovative programs and ideas, I found both my middle school and high school students ready and eager to learn. I showed respect for them and held them to high standards. 

The key was to engage them through real-world, relevant lessons and a creative, high energy approach whenever possible. Several of the ideas included the Shark Tank capstone class, the personal finance real-world budget management exercise, and several business ventures where the class actually sold products they made, sometimes making several hundred dollars. And, when I could, I brought in teachers of different subject areas for a more collaborative and overarching approach.

At the end of my first year of teaching, I was amazed to be awarded the Rosman Career and Technical Education Teacher of the Year for 2013-2014 over 9 seasoned peers. I never would have imagined that would happen and I take great pride in receiving such an honor.

	<h1>Wrestling Coach</h1>
      <p>The wrestling programs that I have been involved in provided me the opportunity to be involved with a branch of students that I didn't get to interact with in the classroom.  The team was made up of a group of hard workers who are dedicated to being successful.  During my time as a wrestling coach I have passed on my skills by leading by example.  I preach leadership, mental toughness, and most importantly never giving up on goals that my wrestlers set for themselves. </p>

	<h1>Exciting Projects!</h1>
      <p>Rosman High School is extremely fortunate to have the only FDA certified kitchen located in a high school in the United States.  During the foods class the students make their own salad dressing which they sell at local stores in the area. On selling day the students were able to use their knowledge to sell over $400 dollars worth of salad dressing in four hours, all while learning valuable marketing, speaking, and life skills in process.   </p>
